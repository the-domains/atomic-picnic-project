**ATOMIC PICNIC PROJECT**

arose by the chance encounter after almost 40 years of two „bedrock veterans"of the Augsburg rock scene, Germany:

**_HELMUTH TREICHEL_**

and

**_KLAUS BADER_**

Both marked by vast and interesting life experiences, heads full of creativity and creative drive, they embarked on the project!

A new musical direction was born:

**„VINTAGE CROSSING"**

A mix of music from the seventies and eighties, complemented with modern sounds and instruments.

Topics range from traumatic events in human history to compassionate love songs to tributes to friendship to just plain and simple (well, not so simple) rock.

The use of various

[professional musicians and singers][0]

contribute to the intensity and variety of this project which can be heard on the already published CDs "

**...**[A Gift For You][1]**"**

and

**"**[Raven's Dance][1]**".  
The next CD is already in the works. Something to look forward to......**
